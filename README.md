- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

- `git clone [repository]`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.

- `git add [file]`: Adds a file or changes to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit.

- `git checkout [branch]`: Switches to a different branch.

- `git merge [branch]`: Combines changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

- `git stash`: Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed.

- `git log`: Displays the commit history of the repository.

- `git status`: Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.

- `git remote`: Lists the remote repositories associated with the current repository.

- `git tag [tagname]`: Marks a specific commit with a tag for easy reference.

These commands are just a selection of the commonly used Git commands. Git provides many more commands and options for managing and collaborating on code. It's recommended to explore the Git documentation and learn more about each command to make the most of Git in your DevOps workflows.
